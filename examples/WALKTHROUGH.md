# Try GhostMCP Doctor on the sample configs

Run these from the GhostMCP Doctor folder. You need Python 3.10 or
newer and nothing else. Nothing here connects to the internet, and
no sample config is modified by any command: Doctor is read-only.

Every command below was run verbatim by Agent B on Oct 14, 2026
against the landed v0.1 core, and the outputs quoted are the real
outputs (paths abbreviated).

## 1. A clean config passes clean

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ghostmcpdoctor scan examples/claude-code.mcp.json --out-dir /tmp/gmd-clean
echo $?
```

```
ghostmcpdoctor scan: 2 server(s) in 1 config(s), 0 finding(s) (exit 0)
```

Exit code 0. The report in `/tmp/gmd-clean/` lists both servers,
and lists the env key `FAKE_API_KEY` by name as present. Its fake
value appears nowhere in either report file:

```bash
grep -rn "FAKE-EXAMPLE" /tmp/gmd-clean/   # no matches
```

## 2. The same name in two clients is a duplicate

`cursor.mcp.json` defines `project-docs` again, with the same
definition as the Claude Code sample:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ghostmcpdoctor scan examples/claude-code.mcp.json examples/cursor.mcp.json --out-dir /tmp/gmd-dup
echo $?
```

```
ghostmcpdoctor scan: 3 server(s) in 2 config(s), 1 finding(s) (exit 1)
  [warn] project-docs - examples/cursor.mcp.json - DUPLICATE: server name also defined in examples/claude-code.mcp.json
```

One finding for the extra definition, naming both config paths.
Doctor reports it; deciding which copy wins is your job, not its.

## 3. The messy config earns its findings

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ghostmcpdoctor scan examples/messy.mcp.json --out-dir /tmp/gmd-messy
echo $?
```

```
ghostmcpdoctor scan: 4 server(s) in 1 config(s), 3 finding(s) (exit 1)
  [warn] filesystem-everywhere - / - BROAD-FILESYSTEM: path argument grants a broad root: /
  [warn] filesystem-everywhere-again - / - BROAD-FILESYSTEM: path argument grants a broad root: /
  [error] gone-tool - examples/messy.mcp.json - MISSING-COMMAND: command not found: ghostmcp-nonexistent-binary-9f3k
```

Note what is *not* there: the fourth server, `key-holder`, produces
no finding and no leak. Its env keys are listed by name in the
report's server inventory as present; their fake values appear in
no output:

```bash
grep -rn "FAKE-EXAMPLE" /tmp/gmd-messy/   # no matches
```

## 4. Re-render a report without re-scanning

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m ghostmcpdoctor report /tmp/gmd-messy/mcpdoctor-report.json --out-dir /tmp/gmd-rerender
```

```
wrote /tmp/gmd-rerender/mcpdoctor-report.json and /tmp/gmd-rerender/MCPDOCTOR.md
```

The re-rendered pair is the shareable artifact: it was redacted at
scan time, so there is nothing left in it to leak. The command
exits with the code recomputed from the stored findings (1 here,
because the messy scan had warnings and errors).

## Reading the reports

- `mcpdoctor-report.json` is the machine-readable form: configs
  scanned, the safe server inventory, findings with issue codes and
  severities, and a summary with stale and duplicate counts.
- `MCPDOCTOR.md` is the same data for humans: summary, per-config
  inventory, findings grouped for reading.
- Exit codes: 0 = scanned, nothing above info; 1 = warnings or
  errors found; 2 = could not scan at all.
